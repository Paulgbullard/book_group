# book_group

The NHS R Community has a book group, we meet every other Friday to discuss two chapters of whatever we're reading at the moment. A member of the group gives a 10-15 minute presentation at the beginning of each group to refresh everyone and give their take, and these presentations will be archived here (with a CC0 licence, naturally ðŸ˜ƒ)

See indiviudal folders for presentations on each book
